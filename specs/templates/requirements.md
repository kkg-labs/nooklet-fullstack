# Requirements Template Instructions

**For AI Agents: Use this template structure when creating requirements.md files**

## Template Structure

```markdown
# Requirements Specification: [Title]

## Overview
[Brief description of what needs to be built and why]

## Context & Background
[Relevant background information, existing system context, user needs]

## Requirements

### REQ-001: [Requirement Name]
**Description:** [Clear description of what is needed]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific, measurable deliverable 1]
- [ ] [Specific, measurable deliverable 2]
- [ ] [Specific, measurable deliverable 3]

### REQ-002: [Second Requirement Name]
**Description:** [Clear description of what is needed]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific, measurable deliverable 1]
- [ ] [Specific, measurable deliverable 2]

[Continue with additional requirements as needed - typically 3-5 total]

## Success Metrics
[How success will be measured - user engagement, performance, etc.]

## Constraints & Assumptions
[Known limitations, technical constraints, assumptions about user behavior]

## Out of Scope
[What is explicitly not included in this specification]

## Instructions for AI Agents

1. **Title**: Use the exact title from the user's request
2. **Overview**: Provide a concise summary of the feature/task/issue
3. **Context**: Include relevant background that helps understand the need
4. **Requirements**: Create 3-5 main requirements, each with 2-5 acceptance criteria
5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Use checkboxes and make them specific and measurable
6. **Success Metrics**: Define how success will be measured
7. **Constraints**: Include technical limitations and assumptions
8. **Out of Scope**: Clearly state what is not included

## Key Principles

- Focus on **what** and **why**, not **how**
- Provide enough context for discovery without overfitting
- Make acceptance criteria specific and testable
- Avoid implementation details that may change
- Use clear, actionable language
