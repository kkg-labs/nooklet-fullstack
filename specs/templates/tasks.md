## Instructions for AI Agents

1. **Break Down Work**: Divide implementation into logical phases
2. **Size Tasks Appropriately**: Each task should take ~20-60 minutes for a professional developer
3. **Define Dependencies**: Clearly specify which tasks depend on others
4. **Be Specific**: Include detailed descriptions and specific deliverables
5. **Estimate Time**: Provide realistic time estimates
6. **Plan Testing**: Include testing tasks in appropriate phases
7. **Consider Documentation**: Include documentation tasks

## Task Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation & Setup**
- Database changes, configuration, basic setup

**Phase 2: Core Implementation**
- Main feature development, core functionality

**Phase 3: Integration & Testing**
- Integration with existing systems, testing

**Phase 4: Deployment & Documentation**
- Final deployment steps, documentation updates

## Key Principles

- Tasks should be specific and actionable
- Dependencies should be clearly defined
- Time estimates should be realistic
- Deliverables should be concrete and verifiable
- Status tracking enables progress monitoring
- Risk assessment helps anticipate problems
