# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the login and logout functionality for Nooklet, enabling users to authenticate and manage their sessions. Building upon the existing registration system, this feature completes the core authentication flow by allowing registered users to securely access their accounts and safely terminate their sessions.

The login system will follow the same design patterns established in the registration page, using Inertia.js forms, daisyUI components, and session-based authentication. The logout functionality will provide a secure way for users to end their sessions and protect their privacy.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the core product vision by:

- **Speed & Simplicity**: Providing a friction-free login experience that gets users to their nooklets quickly
- **Privacy & Control**: Ensuring secure authentication and giving users control over their session management
- **TTFN (Time to First Nooklet)**: Enabling returning users to access their content within seconds of login
- **Security Standards**: Implementing robust authentication following established security best practices

The authentication system is foundational to all other features, enabling personalized nooklet management, privacy controls, and user-specific content organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Login

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log into my account using my email and password, so that I can access my personal nooklets and account features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/login` THEN the system SHALL display a login form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to the dashboard
3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages without revealing whether the email exists
4. WHEN a user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them away from the login page
5. WHEN login fails due to server error THEN the system SHALL display a generic error message and allow retry
6. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL establish a secure session that persists across browser tabs
7. WHEN a user clicks "Remember me" THEN the system SHALL extend the session duration appropriately

### Requirement 2: Session Management

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my session to be managed securely, so that I remain authenticated while using the application and my account stays protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL create a secure session with appropriate expiration
2. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page with an appropriate message
3. WHEN a user accesses protected routes without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
4. WHEN a user closes their browser THEN the system SHALL maintain their session if "Remember me" was selected
5. WHEN a user's session is active THEN the system SHALL share user information via Inertia shared props
6. WHEN session validation fails THEN the system SHALL clear the invalid session and require re-authentication

### Requirement 3: User Logout

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to log out of my account, so that I can protect my privacy and end my session securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL immediately terminate their session
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the landing page or login page
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all session data and authentication tokens
4. WHEN logout is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message
5. WHEN a user attempts to access protected routes after logout THEN the system SHALL redirect them to login
6. WHEN logout fails due to server error THEN the system SHALL still clear client-side session data

### Requirement 4: Form Validation and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user attempting to log in, I want clear feedback on form validation and errors, so that I can successfully authenticate without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits an empty email field THEN the system SHALL display "Email is required" error
2. WHEN a user submits an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display "Please enter a valid email address" error
3. WHEN a user submits an empty password field THEN the system SHALL display "Password is required" error
4. WHEN form submission is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable the submit button and show loading state
5. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight the relevant fields and display specific error messages
6. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
7. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL clear any previous error messages

### Requirement 5: Integration with Existing Registration Flow

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless navigation between login and registration, so that I can easily access the appropriate form based on my account status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the login page THEN the system SHALL provide a clear link to the registration page
2. WHEN a user is on the registration page THEN the system SHALL provide a clear link to the login page
3. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL optionally redirect them to login or auto-authenticate
4. WHEN navigation links are clicked THEN the system SHALL preserve any appropriate form state or error context
5. WHEN a user accesses `/register` while authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the dashboard
6. WHEN a user accesses `/login` while authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the dashboard

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Login validator, service, and controller should each handle distinct concerns
- **Modular Design**: Login components should reuse existing form components (LabeledTextInput, TextInput)
- **Dependency Management**: Authentication service should be separate from registration service but may share common utilities
- **Clear Interfaces**: Login and logout should follow the same patterns as registration for consistency

### Performance

- **Response Time**: Login authentication should complete within 500ms under normal load
- **Session Management**: Session validation should add minimal overhead to protected route requests
- **Form Responsiveness**: Login form should provide immediate feedback on user interactions
- **Logout Speed**: Logout should complete immediately without waiting for server confirmation

### Security

- **Password Protection**: Passwords must never be logged or exposed in error messages
- **Session Security**: Sessions must use secure, httpOnly cookies with appropriate expiration
- **CSRF Protection**: All authentication forms must include CSRF protection
- **Rate Limiting**: Login attempts should be rate-limited to prevent brute force attacks
- **Secure Redirects**: Post-authentication redirects must validate destination URLs
- **Session Invalidation**: Logout must completely invalidate server-side session data

### Reliability

- **Error Handling**: Authentication failures should be handled gracefully without exposing system details
- **Session Recovery**: Invalid sessions should be handled transparently with appropriate user messaging
- **Database Connectivity**: Authentication should handle database connection issues gracefully
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Multiple browser tabs should share session state appropriately

### Usability

- **Consistent Design**: Login page should match the visual design and patterns of the registration page
- **Clear Navigation**: Users should easily understand how to switch between login and registration
- **Error Messaging**: Error messages should be helpful and actionable without being overly technical
- **Accessibility**: Login form should be fully accessible with proper labels, focus management, and keyboard navigation
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Login interface should work seamlessly on mobile devices
- **Loading States**: Users should receive clear feedback during authentication processes
