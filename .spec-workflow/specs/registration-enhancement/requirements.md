# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification enhances the existing user registration system in Nooklet by adding comprehensive end-to-end testing with Playwright, improving error handling, and ensuring the complete registration flow works seamlessly from frontend to backend with proper database verification.

The current registration system includes backend models (AuthUser, Profile), services, controllers, validators, frontend React components, and Japa functional tests. This enhancement focuses on adding robust E2E testing and verification to ensure the complete user journey works as expected.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the product steering goals of:
- **Speed & Simplicity**: Ensuring TTFN (Time to First Nooklet) < 3 minutes through reliable registration
- **Privacy & Control**: Proper user account creation with secure credential handling
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing to maintain 99.9% uptime SLO

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: End-to-End Registration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive E2E tests for the registration flow, so that I can ensure the complete user journey works reliably across browser environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL render the registration form with all required fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create both AuthUser and Profile records in the database
3. WHEN a user submits invalid data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation errors without creating database records
4. WHEN a user attempts to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL display an email conflict error
5. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message and redirect appropriately
6. WHEN the registration form is submitted THEN the system SHALL handle CSRF protection correctly

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during registration, so that I can successfully create my account without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display field-specific error messages
2. WHEN the form is processing THEN the system SHALL show loading states and disable the submit button
3. WHEN an unexpected error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
4. WHEN registration succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide clear confirmation feedback

### Requirement 3: Database Verification and Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure registration creates proper database records, so that user data is correctly stored and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL create an AuthUser record with hashed password
2. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL create a linked Profile record
3. WHEN registration fails THEN the system SHALL NOT create any database records (transaction rollback)
4. WHEN a user provides a username THEN the system SHALL store it in the Profile record
5. WHEN a user omits username THEN the system SHALL create Profile with null username

### Requirement 4: Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the registration to work consistently across different browsers, so that I can create my account regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registration is tested THEN the system SHALL work correctly in Chromium-based browsers
2. WHEN registration is tested THEN the system SHALL work correctly in Firefox
3. WHEN registration is tested THEN the system SHALL work correctly in WebKit/Safari
4. WHEN form interactions occur THEN the system SHALL handle keyboard navigation properly

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each test file should focus on specific registration scenarios
- **Modular Design**: Test utilities should be reusable across different test suites
- **Dependency Management**: Tests should properly clean up database state between runs
- **Clear Interfaces**: Test helpers should have well-defined contracts

### Performance
- E2E tests should complete within 30 seconds for the full registration suite
- Database cleanup should be efficient and not impact test execution time
- Page load times during testing should be under 2 seconds

### Security
- Tests should verify CSRF protection is working correctly
- Password hashing should be verified in database records
- Sensitive data should not be logged or exposed in test output

### Reliability
- Tests should be deterministic and not flaky
- Database state should be properly isolated between test runs
- Tests should handle network delays and async operations correctly

### Usability
- Test output should be clear and actionable for developers
- Failed tests should provide sufficient debugging information
- Test setup should be straightforward for new developers
