# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical CSS theming issue where DaisyUI custom CSS variables are not being applied correctly in the frontend. Specifically, the `--color-primary` variable is set to `red` in the app.css file but the button with class `btn btn-primary` displays as purple instead of red. This indicates a fundamental problem with how DaisyUI v5 theme variables are being processed and applied.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the product's need for consistent, customizable theming and ensures that the design system works as expected. Proper CSS variable functionality is essential for maintaining brand consistency and enabling future theme customizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: CSS Variable Investigation and Root Cause Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand why DaisyUI CSS variables are not being applied correctly, so that I can fix the theming system and ensure design consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN investigating the CSS compilation process THEN the system SHALL identify whether the issue is in build-time processing or runtime application
2. WHEN examining the DaisyUI v5 theme configuration THEN the system SHALL verify if the `@plugin "daisyui/theme"` syntax is correctly implemented
3. WHEN checking CSS specificity THEN the system SHALL determine if default DaisyUI themes are overriding custom variables
4. WHEN analyzing the CSS output THEN the system SHALL confirm whether custom variables are present in the compiled CSS
5. WHEN testing CSS variable inheritance THEN the system SHALL verify that variables are accessible to DaisyUI components

### Requirement 2: DaisyUI v5 Theme Configuration Fix

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the DaisyUI theme configuration to work correctly with custom CSS variables, so that my design tokens are properly applied to components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting `--color-primary: red` in the theme configuration THEN the btn-primary component SHALL display with red background
2. WHEN using DaisyUI v5 syntax THEN the theme variables SHALL override default theme colors
3. WHEN the page loads THEN custom CSS variables SHALL be available in the browser's computed styles
4. WHEN inspecting the button element THEN the background-color SHALL resolve to the custom red value
5. WHEN changing CSS variables THEN the changes SHALL be reflected immediately in the UI

### Requirement 3: CSS vs SCSS Evaluation and Recommendation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand whether using SCSS would provide better CSS variable management and theming capabilities, so that I can make an informed decision about the project's styling architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating SCSS benefits THEN the system SHALL analyze advantages for variable management, nesting, and mixins
2. WHEN considering DaisyUI compatibility THEN the system SHALL verify SCSS support with DaisyUI v5 and Tailwind CSS v4
3. WHEN assessing build complexity THEN the system SHALL compare CSS vs SCSS compilation overhead
4. WHEN reviewing maintainability THEN the system SHALL evaluate code organization and developer experience benefits
5. WHEN making recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance based on project needs and team preferences

### Requirement 4: Frontend Debugging and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive frontend debugging tools and validation, so that I can verify the fix works correctly and prevent similar issues in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using browser developer tools THEN CSS variables SHALL be visible and editable in the Elements panel
2. WHEN testing the button component THEN the computed styles SHALL show the correct custom primary color
3. WHEN validating the theme THEN all DaisyUI color variables SHALL resolve to their custom values
4. WHEN checking CSS cascade THEN there SHALL be no conflicting styles overriding custom variables
5. WHEN performing regression testing THEN other UI components SHALL maintain their correct styling

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: CSS theme configuration should be centralized and clearly separated from component styles
- **Modular Design**: Theme variables should be organized in logical groups (colors, spacing, typography)
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize conflicts between DaisyUI, Tailwind CSS, and custom CSS
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between theme variables and component implementations

### Performance
- CSS compilation time should not significantly increase
- Runtime CSS variable resolution should be efficient
- Bundle size impact should be minimal

### Security
- No CSS injection vulnerabilities through dynamic variable manipulation
- Sanitized color values and CSS properties

### Reliability
- Theme variables should work consistently across different browsers
- Fallback values should be provided for unsupported CSS features
- Build process should fail gracefully if theme configuration is invalid

### Usability
- Theme customization should be straightforward for developers
- CSS variables should be discoverable and well-documented
- Error messages should be clear when theme configuration fails
