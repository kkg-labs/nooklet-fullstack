# Nooklet UI/UX Specification

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for **Nooklet**'s user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**Primary Personas:**
- **The Reflective Creator:** Knowledge workers and content creators who need to capture thoughts quickly but want them organized and retrievable. Values speed of capture but also depth of reflection.
- **The Overwhelmed Curator:** Users struggling with "bookmark graveyard" - they save content but never revisit it. Needs motivation and intelligent surfacing to actually consume saved material.
- **The Pattern Seeker:** Users who want to understand their own thoughts and behaviors over time. Values AI insights, mood tracking, and discovering connections between past and present experiences.

### Usability Goals

**Core Usability Targets:**
- **Time to First Nooklet (TTFN)**: <3 minutes from signup to first published nooklet (directly from PRD)
- **Capture Friction**: New nooklet creation in <30 seconds for returning users
- **Discovery Delight**: Users find relevant past content within 2 clicks of current context
- **Privacy Confidence**: 100% clarity on privacy settings before publishing any content
- **AI Trust**: Users understand and can control all AI-generated insights and suggestions

### Design Principles

**Core Design Principles:**
1. **Capture First, Organize Later** - Never let organization complexity block the creative flow
2. **Intelligent Surfacing Over Manual Search** - AI should proactively surface relevant content rather than requiring users to remember and search
3. **Privacy by Design** - Every interaction should make privacy controls obvious and accessible
4. **Progressive Disclosure of Power** - Start simple, reveal advanced features as users demonstrate need
5. **Emotional Context Awareness** - Design should acknowledge and respond to user's emotional state and patterns

## Information Architecture (IA)

```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** 
- **Main Timeline Editor** - Single-page app with full markdown editor as the primary interface
- **Collection Filters** - Top navigation bar for filtering timeline by collection
- **Settings** - Minimal settings access (entry gap timing, privacy, export)

**Secondary Navigation:**
- **Day/Time Grouping** - Visual groupings in timeline, no separate navigation needed
- **Collection Assignment** - Contextual tagging of current entry to collections
- **Timestamp Indicators** - Visual cues showing time gaps within entries

**Breadcrumb Strategy:**
- **No breadcrumbs needed** - Single-page timeline interface with collection filtering
- **Context preservation** - Current collection filter and scroll position maintained

## User Flows

### Flow 1: First-Time User Onboarding & First Entry

**User Goal:** Get from signup to first nooklet entry in <3 minutes (TTFN goal)

**Entry Points:** Landing page, referral links, direct signup

**Success Criteria:** User has created their first entry and understands the basic concept

#### Flow Diagram:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Landing Page] --> B[Sign Up/Login]
    B --> C[Welcome Overlay on Editor]
    C --> D[User starts typing immediately]
    D --> E[Auto-save begins]
    E --> F[Collection assignment prompt appears]
    F --> G[User selects/creates first collection]
    G --> H[First entry created successfully]
    H --> I[Subtle success feedback]
    
    C --> C1[Skip tutorial - start typing]
    F --> F1[Skip collection - defaults to 'General']
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- User closes browser during onboarding → Auto-save preserves partial content
- User doesn't select collection → Defaults to "General" collection
- Network issues during signup → Offline mode with sync when reconnected
- User types nothing for 10+ minutes → Gentle prompt to continue or save

### Flow 2: Daily Writing & Entry Management

**User Goal:** Seamlessly capture thoughts throughout the day with automatic entry organization

**Entry Points:** Returning to the main timeline editor

**Success Criteria:** Multiple entries created naturally based on time gaps and collection changes

#### Flow Diagram:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User opens Nooklet] --> B[Timeline loads with today's entries]
    B --> C[User starts typing at cursor position]
    C --> D[Typing in current entry]
    D --> E{Time gap > 45min?}
    E -->|No| F[Continue current entry]
    E -->|Yes| G[Create new entry]
    
    D --> H{User changes collection?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Force new entry creation]
    H -->|No| F
    
    F --> J[Debounced auto-save every 5min pause]
    G --> K[New entry with timestamp]
    I --> K
    K --> L[Visual entry separation in timeline]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- User accidentally changes collection → Undo option to merge back
- Multiple rapid collection changes → Prevent spam entry creation
- Long writing session (>2 hours) → Periodic timestamp markers within entry
- Browser crash during writing → Auto-recovery of unsaved content

### Flow 3: Collection-Based Filtering & Organization

**User Goal:** Focus on specific topics/projects by filtering timeline to relevant entries

**Entry Points:** Collection filter top bar, search, or direct collection links

**Success Criteria:** User can quickly switch between different content contexts

#### Flow Diagram:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User in main timeline] --> B[Clicks collection filter]
    B --> C[Timeline filters to collection entries]
    C --> D[Current typing area tags to this collection]
    D --> E[User continues writing in filtered context]
    E --> F{User switches to different collection?}
    F -->|Yes| G[New entry created automatically]
    F -->|No| H[Continue in current collection context]
    G --> I[Timeline updates to new collection view]
    I --> J[Previous entry saved to old collection]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Empty collection selected → Show empty state with writing prompt
- User creates new collection while typing → Current entry gets tagged to new collection
- Rapid collection switching → Debounce to prevent excessive entry creation

### Flow 4: Memory Snippet Discovery (Future Feature)

**User Goal:** Discover relevant past thoughts while writing about similar topics

**Entry Points:** AI detects entities/topics in current writing

**Success Criteria:** User finds valuable connections to past entries without disrupting writing flow

#### Flow Diagram:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User typing about topic X] --> B[AI detects entities/keywords]
    B --> C[AI searches past entries for related content]
    C --> D[Memory snippets appear subtly beside editor]
    D --> E{User engages with memory?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Snippet expands to show full context]
    E -->|No| G[Snippets fade after 30 seconds]
    F --> H[User can click to view full original entry]
    F --> I[User can reference/link in current entry]
    G --> J[Continue writing uninterrupted]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- No related memories found → No snippets shown (don't force it)
- Too many memories → Show only top 2-3 most relevant
- User finds memories distracting → Settings to reduce/disable
- Memory snippet loading slow → Show placeholder, load asynchronously

- **300-500**: Mid-range for secondary elements and muted text
- **600-800**: Primary brand colors and active states
- **900-1000**: Darkest tones for backgrounds and depth

**Accent System (--color-accent-*):**
- Warm accent palette (50.3 hue) providing contrast to the cool navy foundation
- Used sparingly for special highlights and future AI memory features

### Typography

#### Font Families
- **Primary:** System font stack (Inter-like) for UI elements and metadata
- **Editor:** Monospace (JetBrains Mono/Fira Code) for markdown editing
- **Content:** Serif (Georgia/Charter) for rendered markdown content

#### Type Scale
Following your existing DaisyUI integration with custom brand tokens.

### Spacing & Layout

**Border Radius System:**
- `--radius-selector`: 0.375rem (6px) - Small interactive elements
- `--radius-field`: 0.5rem (8px) - Input fields and form elements
- `--radius-box`: 0.75rem (12px) - Cards and larger containers

**Border System:**
- `--border`: 1px standard border width
- `--input-border`: Uses `--color-base-300` for consistent field styling

### Iconography

**Icon Library:** Heroicons or Lucide React for consistent, minimal icon style

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Use outline style for inactive states, filled style for active states
- Maintain 16px or 20px sizes for UI consistency
- Icons should support the writing flow, not distract from it

### Spacing & Layout

**Grid System:** 8px base unit system for consistent spacing throughout interface

**Spacing Scale:**
- xs: 4px (tight spacing within components)
- sm: 8px (component internal spacing)
- md: 16px (standard component spacing)
- lg: 24px (section spacing)
- xl: 32px (major layout spacing)
- 2xl: 48px (page-level spacing)

## Accessibility Requirements

### Compliance Target

**Standard:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with progressive enhancement toward AAA where feasible, particularly for color contrast and keyboard navigation.

### Key Requirements

**Visual:**
- **Color contrast ratios:** Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text against your navy background
- **Focus indicators:** Clear, high-contrast focus rings for all interactive elements (collection filters, timestamps, entry boundaries)
- **Text sizing:** Support browser zoom up to 200% without horizontal scrolling or content loss
- **Color independence:** All information conveyed by color (collection tags, entry states) must also be available through text or icons

**Interaction:**
- **Keyboard navigation:** Full keyboard access to all features - Tab through collections, arrow keys for entry navigation, standard markdown shortcuts
- **Screen reader support:** Proper semantic markup for timeline structure, entry boundaries, and collection relationships
- **Touch targets:** Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile collection filters and interactive elements
- **Focus management:** Logical focus order through timeline entries and collection filters

**Content:**
- **Alternative text:** Descriptive text for any icons or visual indicators (collection status, auto-save states, time gaps)
- **Heading structure:** Proper heading hierarchy for entry organization and timeline navigation
- **Form labels:** Clear labels and descriptions for collection creation and settings

### Testing Strategy

**Automated Testing:**
- Integration with axe-core for continuous accessibility monitoring
- Color contrast validation for all brand color combinations
- Keyboard navigation testing in CI/CD pipeline

- **Tablet**: Collection filters remain at top, editor gets comfortable margins, timeline entries stack naturally
- **Desktop**: Optimal layout with top navigation, spacious editor area, and room for future memory snippets
- **Wide**: Additional whitespace, potential for side panels (future AI features), but editor remains centered

**Navigation Changes:**
- **Mobile**: Collection filters collapse to hamburger menu or horizontal scrolling tabs
- **Tablet**: Collection filters as horizontal tabs with overflow scrolling if needed
- **Desktop**: Full collection filter display in top navigation bar
- **Wide**: Collection filters with additional space for more collections or enhanced filtering

**Content Priority:**
- **Mobile**: Editor takes full priority, timeline entries below with minimal metadata visible
- **Tablet**: Balanced view with editor prominent but timeline entries showing more context
- **Desktop**: Full timeline context with entry metadata, timestamps, and collection indicators
- **Wide**: Enhanced timeline view with potential for memory snippets and advanced features

**Interaction Changes:**
- **Mobile**: Touch-optimized targets (44px minimum), swipe gestures for collection switching
- **Tablet**: Hybrid touch/keyboard interaction, larger touch targets for precision
- **Desktop**: Keyboard-first interaction with mouse support, hover states for additional context
- **Wide**: Full keyboard shortcuts, enhanced hover states, potential for advanced power-user features

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

**Motion Principles:**
- **Purposeful movement**: Every animation serves a functional purpose (feedback, guidance, or state communication)
- **Respect writing flow**: Animations never interrupt active typing or thinking
- **Subtle enhancement**: Motion enhances understanding rather than drawing attention to itself
- **Performance conscious**: Smooth 60fps animations that don't impact editor responsiveness
- **Accessibility aware**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for users who need minimal animation

### Key Animations

**Entry Creation & Boundaries:**
- **New entry formation**: Subtle fade-in (300ms, ease-out) when 45-minute gap creates new entry
- **Entry separation**: Gentle slide-down (200ms, ease-in-out) when new entry appears above current writing
- **Time gap indicators**: Soft pulse (1s, ease-in-out) when 5-minute pause creates timestamp marker

**Collection & Filter Transitions:**
- **Collection switching**: Smooth timeline filter (400ms, ease-in-out) with content fade-out/fade-in
- **Filter state changes**: Quick highlight (150ms, ease-out) on active collection tab
- **Collection creation**: Inline expansion (250ms, ease-out) for new collection input field

**Auto-save & Status Feedback:**
- **Save progress**: Subtle spinner or dot animation (continuous, 2s rotation) during auto-save
- **Save confirmation**: Brief checkmark flash (500ms, ease-out) when save completes
- **Connection status**: Gentle color transition (300ms, ease-in-out) for online/offline states

**Timeline Navigation:**
- **Scroll position**: Smooth scroll (600ms, ease-in-out) when jumping to specific dates or entries
- **Entry focus**: Subtle highlight fade-in (200ms, ease-out) when navigating between entries
- **Hover states**: Quick opacity/color transitions (100ms, ease-out) for interactive elements

**Future Memory Snippets:**
- **Snippet appearance**: Gentle slide-in from right (400ms, ease-out) when AI detects relevance
- **Snippet dismissal**: Quick fade-out (200ms, ease-in) when user dismisses or context changes
- **Relevance indication**: Soft glow or border animation (300ms, ease-in-out) connecting snippet to relevant text

**Loading & State Changes:**
- **Content loading**: Skeleton animation (1.5s, ease-in-out) for timeline entries loading
- **Error states**: Gentle shake (300ms, ease-out) for failed operations
- **Success feedback**: Brief scale animation (200ms, ease-out) for successful actions

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Keystroke Response:** <16ms latency for typing input (60fps target)
- **Auto-save Operations:** <100ms for debounced save operations
- **Timeline Rendering:** <200ms for filtering/switching collections with 1000+ entries
- **Memory Usage:** <50MB baseline, <100MB with large timeline histories
- **Initial Load:** <2s for application ready state, <1s for returning users

### Design Strategies

**Real-time Editor Optimization:**
- **Virtual scrolling** for timeline with 1000+ entries to maintain smooth scrolling
- **Debounced auto-save** (5-minute typing pause) to prevent excessive server requests
- **Local-first architecture** with optimistic updates for immediate feedback
- **Incremental rendering** for markdown parsing to avoid blocking the main thread
- **Memory-efficient** entry storage with lazy loading for historical content

**Timeline Performance:**
- **Pagination strategy** for historical entries (load 50 entries initially, infinite scroll for more)
- **Collection filtering** happens client-side for instant switching between collections
- **Entry caching** to avoid re-rendering unchanged content during scrolling
- **Timestamp indexing** for fast date-based navigation and search

**Network Optimization:**
- **Offline-first** design with service worker for uninterrupted writing during connectivity issues
- **Delta sync** for auto-save operations (only send changed content, not entire entries)
- **Background sync** for queued operations when connection is restored
- **CDN optimization** for static assets and font loading

**Memory Management:**
- **Entry virtualization** to render only visible timeline entries
- **Component cleanup** for unmounted entries to prevent memory leaks
- **Image lazy loading** for any embedded media in entries
- **Garbage collection** optimization for long writing sessions

**Future AI Feature Performance:**
- **Async memory snippet generation** that doesn't block writing interface
- **Cached similarity searches** for frequently accessed content connections
- **Progressive enhancement** where AI features load after core editor is ready
- **Throttled AI requests** to prevent overwhelming the system during active typing
