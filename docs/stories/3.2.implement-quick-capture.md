### **Story Title: Ensure Home Page Markdown Editor Functions as Quick Capture**

**User Story:**
As a Creator,
I want the home page markdown editor to function as a quick capture tool with immediate saving,
so that my thoughts are instantly recorded and visible in my timeline.

**Story Context:**
*   **Integrates with:** Existing home page markdown editor, Nooklet creation flow, auto-save mechanisms.
*   **Technology:** React, AdonisJS backend.
*   **Pattern:** Immediate persistence, continuous capture.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  Any text entered into the home page markdown editor is immediately saved as a new nooklet or updates an existing one in the user's timeline.
2.  The saving process is seamless and non-blocking, providing subtle visual feedback (e.g., "Saving...", "Saved").
3.  New nooklets created via the home page editor appear chronologically in the user's timeline without requiring an explicit "publish" action.
4.  Existing auto-save mechanisms are adapted to this immediate saving behavior, ensuring data integrity.
5.  New tests verify the immediate saving, timeline display, and continuous capture functionality.

**Technical Notes:**
*   Adapt the existing auto-save logic to trigger immediate saves to the database upon user input.
*   Ensure the backend handles the continuous stream of updates from the editor efficiently.
*   Verify that new entries appear in the timeline without a separate "publish" step.

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Functional requirements are met and tested.
- [ ] All existing and new tests pass.
